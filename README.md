# Impose - A BookletMaker Demo project

This project is an example usage of my BookletMaker tool.

Included are two Affinity Publisher documents, one that generates the seperated page SVGs, and the other that consumes a CSV file that sets those pages into an order fit for signature binding such as coptic stiching.
