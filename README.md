# Impose - A bookletMaker Demo project

This project is an example usage of my [bookletMaker](https://github.com/dotHTM/bookletMaker) tool.

Included are two Affinity Publisher documents, one that generates the seperated page SVGs, and the other that consumes a CSV file that sets those pages into an order fit for signature binding such as coptic stiching.
